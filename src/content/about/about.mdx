      - "I am a Lead Frontend Engineer focused on building practical solutions and workflows that solve real-world bottlenecks. In 2013 I joined Monsoon, an agency where I learned to build fast, scalable products for a wide variety of clients. Following Monsoon's acquisition by Capital One in 2015, I spent the next decade evolving from a hands-on developer to the technical lead on the Comets (Homepage) team—the group responsible for building, testing, and maintaining the bank's most visited entry point: the Capital One homepage. Our team was also responsible for several other high-traffic sections of the site and built strategic solutions that increased traffic and product sales."
      - "Throughout my career, I’ve often been the person called in to handle complex orphaned projects, tricky integrations, or legacy migrations that require a focus on simplification and long-term stability. I specialize in taking technical problems and turning them into something maintainable. Over time, my focus has shifted from just fixing what’s broken to building the internal tools and processes that help keep workflows efficient and scalable."
      - "I’ve found that the most effective way to support a team is by focusing on the \"how\" of shipping—whether that means building a custom tool to bypass a deployment bottleneck or developing the initial proof of concept to set a clear technical standard. Having worked closely with designers and product owners for years, I’ve learned how to bridge the gap between their vision and the technical realities of the browser. This means advocating for accessibility (WCAG) and performance as core features, ensuring that the final product is stable, fast, and works for everyone."
