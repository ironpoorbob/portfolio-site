title: "Enterprise Search: Decoupled Rules Engine"
role: "Tech Lead / Architect"
year: 2024
duration: "2-3 months"
teamSize: "3 Devs (Lead + 2)"
outcomeSummary: "Enabled instant content updates via CMS, bypassing CI/CD bottleneck and driving measurable lift in user conversions (NABs)."
overview: "Architected a 'Rules Engine' that decoupled business data from the application logic. By moving the mapping of search terms and component triggers into a CDN-hosted JSON configuration, the Angular frontend became a dynamic delivery vehicle. This allowed the Product team to update 'upsell' content and run A/B tests instantly without waiting for code deployments."

problem: "Our Jenkins CI/CD pipeline was a massive bottleneck; a single UI change required a multi-stage gauntlet of unit tests, E2E tests, and security scans that could take days to clear. This made it impossible for the Product team to iterate on high-traffic search results or react to market trends in real-time."

constraints:
  - "Backend API was not yet ready to return specialized marketing metadata."
  - "Must maintain performance and light payload."
  - "Required 100% WCAG accessibility compliance and custom analytics integration."
  - "Solution needed to be a flexible 'shim' for future backend integration."

approach: "Instead of hard-coding search result variations into the app, we built an Angular service that acted as a matching engine. This service fetched a remote JSON file from the CDN on initialization. When a user performed a search, the engine performed a direct match between the query and the JSON keys to determine which high-impact components (FAQs, CTA banners, or products) to render. I developed the initial POC and established the service architecture, then led a small team to build out the modular component library."

keyDecisions:
  - decision: "Leverage Bloomreach WCM for JSON-as-a-Service"
    reasoning: "By hosting the 'Rules Engine' in the CMS, we bypassed the Jenkins pipeline entirely. Content editors could update search mappings and deploy to the CDN in minutes, providing total business autonomy."
  - decision: "Architected a Flexible Data Interface"
    reasoning: "Since the API roadmap was still in flux, I designed the frontend service to consume a normalized JSON structure. This acted as a 'shim,' allowing us to deliver business value immediately. I prioritized making the matching logic modular so that when the API eventually came online, we would only need to update the data-fetcher service rather than the entire component architecture."
  - decision: "Parallelized Development Lifecycle"
    reasoning: "After establishing the core service pattern and accessibility standards, I broke the project into modular tasks, allowing the team to build components and tracking services simultaneously to meet the 8-week launch window."
  - decision: "Conditional Asset Loading"
    reasoning: "To protect page performance, I ensured that 'upsell' assets (images/icons) only triggered loading after a successful query match was confirmed by the service."

  metrics:
    - label: "Time-to-Market"
      value: "Reduced from 48 hours to minutes"
    - label: "Product Autonomy"
      value: "100% (No engineering required for content updates)"
    - label: "Business Impact"
      value: "Significant lift in NABs through rapid A/B testing"
  qualitative: "This architecture bridged the gap between a lagging API roadmap and an urgent business need. By building a stable frontend interface for our JSON 'stub,' we decoupled the UI development from the backend's timeline. This allowed us to launch a high-impact feature months early, with the understanding that the system was built to be easily integrated with a live API once the backend schema was finalized."

learnings:
  - "Engineered a way to resolve cross-team dependencies (API/CMS/Design) to clear a technical bottleneck."
  - "Demonstrated how a POC can establish standards that allow a small team to work effectively in parallel."
  - "Solved for the immediate deployment friction while keeping long-term maintenance in mind."

### The Impact

By moving the search criteria into the CMS as a CDN-hosted JSON file, we decoupled the search data from the application code. This allowed the front-end and search query service to perform real-time comparisons against live data, giving the Product team the ability to update additional search results content in minutes. This bypassed the days-long deployment cycle, enabled real-time A/B testing, and ultimately helped us launch the feature ahead of schedule.
